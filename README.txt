Changes involving new libraries, dependencies, imports and other external features,methods,class,field etc.
Should always be followed with the following approach:

1. Go to the gradle menu as provided by your IDE software
1.1. If not present in your interface, go look in the "View" tab in either the UI or in settings and turn it on.
2. Run gradle´s clean task
3. Run gradle´s build task
4. Refresh gradle dependencies
4.1 If libraries are not available make sure that the right version is added to the dependency of the library in the build.gradle file.
